# BestNoteAvalonia

Will Otterbien, 2025/3/7

## What is Avalonia

Avalonia is a framework which also supports cross platform application development.
It is much more mature than MAUI, despite not being a microsoft product.
Will spend this weekend learning and implementing bestnote milestone 1 features using Avalonia since MAUI is not suited for the kind of desktop experience that we want to create.
- Avalonia --> More desktop features, less mobile focused
- MAUI --> Less desktop features, more mobile focused

Avalonia still uses XAML and C# so it is not really all that new, the framework is just better suited for BestNote's design goals compared to MAUI.
